/**
 * Binary Heap - similar to tree
 * Lookup O(n)
 * Insert O(log N)
 * Delete O(log N)
 * Really good for doing comparitive operations.
 * I want a value above 33 (anything on the same level and above will be above 33)
 * , on a binary tree this would be O(n)
 * 
 * Also really useful for Priority Queue, each element has a priory and elements with a higher priority are served first.
